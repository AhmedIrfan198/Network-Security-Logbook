## Skills Learned
- **Malware Analysis:** Understanding the behavior, propagation, and impact of different types of malware.
- **DoS Attack Techniques:** Conducting SYN and ICMP flood attacks and monitoring their impact on network resources.
- **Defense Strategies:** Implementing various defense mechanisms to protect against network attacks.
- **Web Security:** Identifying and mitigating web vulnerabilities.
- **Social Engineering & Phishing:** Understanding and simulating social engineering attacks.
- **Firewall Configuration:** Configuring firewalls to protect network resources.

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark:** For network traffic analysis.
- **hping3:** For crafting and sending custom TCP/IP packets.
- **Nmap:** For network scanning and enumeration.
- **Metasploit:** For exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Curl:** For automating web requests.
- **dos_monitor:** For monitoring network traffic and CPU utilization.
